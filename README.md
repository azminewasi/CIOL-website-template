## Sections
All changes can be done in `index.html` file, as it is a light-weight single page website. For design and colors, change in `css\main.css` file. Images and fonts can be changed in the `resources` folder.

### 1. **Header**
- **Description**: Displays the member's name, a professional title or role, and a brief tagline.
- **How to Use**: Customize the name, title, and tagline directly in the `<header>` section of the HTML file. Replace the default image with a personal one by updating the image source in the `<img>` tag.

### 2. **About Section**
- **Description**: A brief biography about the member, outlining key research areas and interests.
- **How to Use**: Update the content of the `<p>` tag to describe your own professional journey and areas of expertise. You can add more paragraphs or bullet points to expand this section.

### 3. **News and Updates**
- **Description**: A section where recent news, promotions, or paper submissions can be shared. This area is scrollable if the list exceeds 300px.
- **How to Use**: Add or modify news items by updating the `<ul>` list inside the section. Each list item (`<li>`) can be edited to reflect recent achievements or upcoming events.

### 4. **Publications, Active Projects**
- **Description**: Lists the member's published papers and articles with dates, titles, and links to full papers.
- **How to Use**: Add new publications by creating `<li>` elements with the title and relevant links inside the `<ul>` list. Be sure to include the date and co-authors as needed.

## Responsive Design
The website uses a responsive layout, ensuring it looks great on all screen sizes. Media queries ensure that elements adjust their size, fonts, and image dimensions on mobile and desktop views.

### Customization
- **Font**: You can customize the font by editing the `@font-face` in the CSS file.
- **Layout**: Modify the proportions of the image and text blocks in the header and about sections based on your preferences.
- **Color Scheme**: Change colors for backgrounds, fonts, and buttons by editing the `color` and `background-color` properties in the CSS.
