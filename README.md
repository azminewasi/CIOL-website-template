### Customization
- **Font**: You can customize the font by editing the `@font-face` in the CSS file.
- **Layout**: Modify the proportions of the image and text blocks in the header and about sections based on your preferences.
- **Color Scheme**: Change colors for backgrounds, fonts, and buttons by editing the `color` and `background-color` properties in the CSS.
